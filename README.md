# trpointset
Script to boost the TrackPoint speed on Lenovo ThinkPad keyboards.

Built for Bodhi Linux, this script makes it easy to adjust the TrackPoint acceleration on your Lenovo ThinkPad laptop using the **'xinput'** tool. It will install **xinput** if it’s not already there, find the TrackPoint ID, and let you set your preferred acceleration level. Plus, it’ll ask if you want to save the setting so it applies every time you start your computer.

**Install:**

Tested on ThinkPad L440 with Bodhi Linux 7 hwe.
