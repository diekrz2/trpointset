# trpointset
Script that helps to set TrackPoint acceleration.

Script that helps to set TrackPoint acceleration on Lenovo ThinkPad laptops using the 'xinput' tool. Designed for Bodhi Linux. The script installs 'xinput' if it is not already installed, finds the TrackPoint id and allows you to enter the desired acceleration value. Finally, the script asks if you want to save the setting so that it is started at every startup of the PC. 

Download the script and open the terminal in the directory where the script is located. Run it with 'bash trpointset.sh'. 

Tested on ThinkPad L440 with Bodhi Linux 7.
