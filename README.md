# trpointset
Script that helps to set the TrackPoint acceleration value on Lenovo ThinkPad keyboards.

Designed for Bodhi Linux. This script helps to set TrackPoint acceleration on Lenovo ThinkPad laptops using the **'xinput'** tool. The script installs **'xinput'** (if not already installed), finds the TrackPoint id and allows you to enter the desired acceleration value. Finally, the script asks if you want to save the setting so that it takes effect every time you start your computer.
